Sorry it's late.

Only a little bit of build system trickery this time, and nothing that
modifies the default targets.

Running "./diff-all ./ solution samples/" in the root directory will
test my parser against the solution parser for all .decaf files in the
samples directory, printing out diffs if they differ.

As an aside, I believe that the solution is overly restrictive for the
switch case labels -- the assignment document states that they must be
compile-time integer constanst, but the solution only accepts integer
literals.  Literals are probably the intended (and safer) behavior,
but going by the spec, expressions such as "a" and "1+1" should be
permissible as case labels, as they can be compile-time integer
constants.
