Project 1
Taahir Ahmed

I've switched the build system from straight make to cmake, which supports out
of source builds.

To configure the project, starting in the top-level directory:

>mkdir build
>cd build
>CXX=/usr/bin/g++-4.6 cmake ..

This will find flex and configure the project

Then type
>make
to build the project.  My binaries will be in <root>/build, the solution
binaries in <root>/build/solution

>make test

will run a diff test against the provided fragments.
